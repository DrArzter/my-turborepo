# My turborepo

This is my turborepo project designed to help anybody to set up quickly a turborepo project.

During my work on this project i will probably add [notes](./NOTES.md)

For now it's equpped with the following packages/apps:

- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `auth-service`: a [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) app
- `todos-service`: a [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) app
- `packages/database`: a [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) database package ready to be used with any database in any application

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

The **web** package/app has tailwind, shadcn ui support.
